# Python Discord Femboy Bot

# This is a work in progress so i will be making this bettre over time
To start the bot you simply need to launch, either your terminal (Linux, Mac & Windows), or your Command Prompt (
Windows)
.

Before running the bot you will need to install all the requirements with this command:

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that you can start it with

```
python bot.py
```

> **Note**: You may need to replace `python` with `py`, `python3`, `python3.11`, etc. depending on what Python versions you have installed on the machine.

### Docker

Support to start the bot in a Docker container has been added. After having [Docker](https://docker.com) installed on your machine, you can simply execute:

```
docker compose up -d --build
```

> **Note**: `-d` will make the container run in detached mode, so in the background.
